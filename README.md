## Speak Japanese! / 日本語で話せ！

A simple tool to make [Faraday](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday) **Status Report** (Vulnerabilities name, description, severiry, references, etc) in Japanese
The trick is actually on CVE number of each vulnerability, in Japan we have a public CVE DB (in Japanese of course) where we can lookup for CVE's, called JVN iPedia
